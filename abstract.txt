Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow for direct communication between the brain and external devices, frequently using electroencephalography (EEG) to monitor neural activity. Dimensionality reduction and structured regularization are essential for effectively classifying task-related brain signals, including event-related potentials (ERPs) and motor imagery (MI) rhythms. Current tensor-based approaches, such as Tucker and PARAFAC decompositions, often lack the flexibility needed to fully capture the complexity of EEG data. This study introduces Block-Term Tensor Discriminant Analysis (BTTDA): a novel tensor-based and supervised feature extraction method designed to enhance classification accuracy by providing flexible multilinear dimensionality reduction. Extending Higher Order Discriminant Analysis (HODA), BTTDA uses a forward model and deflation scheme to iteratively extract relevant block terms, improving feature representation for classification. BTTDA was evaluated on publicly available ERP (second-order tensor) and MI (third-order tensor) EEG datasets. Results demonstrate that BTTDA significantly outperforms traditional methods, including HODA, in ERP classification. For MI tasks, BTTDA achieved comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods on one dataset and exceeded HODA performance on another. The block-term structure of BTTDA enables more efficient dimensionality reduction without compromising discriminative power, offering a promising and adaptable approach for feature extraction in BCI and broader neuroimaging applications.
