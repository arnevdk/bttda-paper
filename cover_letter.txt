Dear Editor,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript, titled "Block-Term Tensor Discriminant
Analysis for Brain-Computer Interfacing," for consideration as an original
research article in Journal of Neural Engineering. Our study introduces a novel
tensor-based supervised feature extraction method, Block-Term Tensor
Discriminant Analysis (BTTDA), which addresses key challenges in dimensionality
reduction for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).

The field of BCI demands robust approaches that enhance the classification of
complex neural signals. BTTDA, a generalization of Higher Order Discriminan
Analysis, integrates a block-term tensor structure to provide flexible
multilinear dimensionality reduction. Our model demonstrates enhanced
classification accuracy on electroencephalography (EEG) datasets, outperforming
existing methods on ERP classification and yielding competitive results for
motor imagery tasks. This approach offers significant advancements by balancing
effective dimensionality reduction with high discriminative power, marking a
step forward in BCI feature extraction methods.

We believe that BTTDA aligns with the interests of the Journal of Neural
Engineering audience due to its potential applications in neuroprosthetics and
BCI assistive technology development, as well as its broader applicability to
neural signal processing. We confirm that this work is original, has not been
published elsewhere, and is not under consideration by any other journal.
Additionally, all authors have approved this submission.

Thank you for considering our manuscript. We look forward to the possibility of
contributing to Journal of Neural Engineering.
