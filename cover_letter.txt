Dear Editor,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript, titled "Block-Term Tensor Discriminant
Analysis for Brain-Computer Interfacing," for consideration as an original
research article in IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation
Engineering. Our study introduces a novel tensor-based supervised feature
extraction method, Block-Term Tensor Discriminant Analysis (BTTDA), which
addresses key challenges in dimensionality reduction for brain-computer
interfaces (BCIs).

The field of BCI demands robust approaches that enhance the classification of
complex neural signals. BTTDA, a generalization of Higher Order Discriminant
Analysis, integrates a block-term tensor structure to provide flexible
multilinear dimensionality reduction. Our model demonstrates enhanced
classification accuracy on electroencephalography (EEG) benchmark datasets,
outperforming existing methods for ERP classification and yielding results
competitive with other tensor methods for motor imagery tasks. Additionally, our
model's structure allows for interpretation of the contribution of extracted
features and patterns in the original data. In general, this approach offers
significant advancements by balancing effective dimensionality reduction and
discriminative feature extraction in the presence of high-dimensional data,
marking a step forward in tensor and BCI classification techniques.

We believe that BTTDA aligns with the interests of IEEE TNSRE audience due to
its potential applications in neuroprosthetics and BCI assistive technology
development, as well as its broader applicability to neural signal processing.
We confirm that this work is original, has not been published elsewhere, and is
not under consideration by any other journal. All authors have approved this
submission.

Thank you for considering our manuscript. We look forward to the possibility of
contributing to IEEE TNSRE.
