The method reduces the number of parameters by multilinearization, regularizes the ill-posedness via subspaces that constrain the parameter spaces, and incorporates a brain functional connectivity through the constraints. The experimental results show that the proposed method improved the classification accuracy rates in a single-trial ERP processing.},

First, we propose a discriminant tensor criterion (DTC), whereby multiple interrelated lower-dimensional discriminative subspaces are derived for feature selection. Then, a novel approach called k-mode cluster-based discriminant analysis is presented to iteratively learn these subspaces by unfolding the tensor along different tensor dimensions. We call this algorithm discriminant analysis with tensor representation (DATER), which has the following characteristics: 1) multiple interrelated subspaces can collaborate to discriminate different classes; 2) for classification problems involving higher-order tensors, the DATER algorithm can avoid the curse of dimensionality dilemma and overcome the small sample size problem; and 3) the computational cost in the learning stage is reduced to a large extent owing to the reduced data dimensions in generalized eigenvalue decomposition. We provide extensive experiments by encoding face images as 2nd or 3rd order tensors to demonstrate that the proposed DATER algorithm based on higher order tensors has the potential to outperform the traditional subspace learning algorithms, especially in the small sample size cases.},

Most existing classification methods for P300-based BCIs extract features based on temporal structure related to P300 components of event-related potentials (ERPs). Some others exploit the spatial distribution of ERPs optimally selected by recursive channel elimination. However, none of them employed multilinear structures which exploit hidden features in P300-based BCI data. In this paper, we propose a new feature extraction method based on tensor decomposition for ERP-based BCIs. The method seeks an optimal feature subspace simultaneously spanned by temporal and spatial bases, and additional bases which indicate a variant of ERPs obtained by different degrees of polynomial fittings. The proposed method has been evaluated by both the BCI competition III data set II and the affective face driven paradigm data set, and achieved 92\% and 95\% classification accuracies respectively, which were better than those of most existing P300-based BCI algorithms.},

Motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) training has been proved to be an effective communication system between human brain and external devices. A practical problem in BCI-based systems is how to correctly and efficiently identify and extract subject-specific features from the blurred scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and translate those features into device commands in order to control external devices. In real BCI-based applications, we usually define frequency bands and channels configuration that related to brain activities beforehand. However, a steady configuration usually loses effects due to individual variability among different subjects in practical applications. In this study, a robust tensor-based method is proposed for a multiway discriminative subspace extraction from tensor-represented EEG data, which performs well in motor imagery EEG classification without the prior neurophysiologic knowledge like channels configuration and active frequency bands. Motor imagery EEG patterns in spatial-spectral-temporal domain are detected directly from the multidimensional EEG, which may provide insights to the underlying cortical activity patterns. Extensive experiment comparisons have been performed on a benchmark dataset from the famous BCI competition III as well as self-acquired data from healthy subjects and stroke patients. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over the contemporary methods.},

Good classification performance of the ERP-based BCI usually requires sufficient data recordings for effective training of the LDA classifier, and hence a long system calibration time which however may depress the system practicability and cause the users resistance to the BCI system. In this study, we introduce a spatial-temporal discriminant analysis (STDA) to ERP classification. As a multiway extension of the LDA, the STDA method tries to maximize the discriminant information between target and nontarget classes through finding two projection matrices from spatial and temporal dimensions collaboratively, which reduces effectively the feature dimensionality in the discriminant analysis, and hence decreases significantly the number of required training samples. The proposed STDA method was validated with dataset II of the BCI Competition III and dataset recorded from our own experiments, and compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms for ERP classification. Online experiments were additionally implemented for the validation. The superior classification performance in using few training samples shows that the STDA is effective to reduce the system calibration time and improve the classification accuracy, thereby enhancing the practicability of ERP-based BCI.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a tensor-based scheme is introduced for single trial electroencephalogram (EEG) classification in brain computer interfacing (BCI). Firstly, EEG signals are represented as third order tensors in the spatial–spectral–temporal domain by wavelet transform. Then, a regularized tensor discriminant analysis (RTDA) algorithm is proposed for a multi-way discriminative subspace extraction from tensor-represented EEG data. Unlike the conventional wavelet transform method, the proposed scheme includes the structural information in multi-channel time-varying EEG spectrums endorsed by tensor representation, and improves the performance for EEG classification. Compared with the common spatial pattern (CSP, the most successful algorithm in BCI) in the applications to two classes of datasets, the proposed scheme has the following advantages: (1) an optimal multi-way discriminative subspace can be extracted, obtaining significant spatial–spectral–temporal patterns for EEG classification; (2) the proposed scheme can identify discriminative characteristics robustly, and works well without prior neurophysiologic knowledge. This is a valuable property for developing new paradigms in BCI whose discriminative neural correlates are not known and (3) the proposed scheme is able to find the most significant channels for classification, and can be applied to channel selection in BCI. Computer simulations show that the number of used channels can be reduced to 2in two datasets with very little loss in performance. Therefore, it has great potential for the practical application of BCI.},

Such applications have gained widespread interest for enabling users to issue commands volitionally. In conventional motor BCIs features extracted from brain signals are concatenated into vector- or matrix-based (or one-/two-way) representations. Nevertheless, when accounting for the original multimodal or multiway signal structure, decoding performance has been shown to improve jointly with result interpretability. However, as multiway decoders are notorious for the extensive computational cost to train them, conventional ones are still preferred. To curb this limitation, we introduce a novel multiway classifier, called Block-Term Tensor Classifier that inherits the improved accuracy of multiway methods while providing fast training. We show that it can outperform state-of-the-art multiway and two-way Linear Discriminant Analysis classifiers in asynchronous detection of individual finger movements from intracranial recordings, an essential feature to achieve a sense of dexterity with hand prosthetics and exoskeletons.},

We demonstrate how corresponding algorithms, for example, linear discriminant analysis, principal component analysis and independent component analysis, can be used to remove eye-motion artifacts, extract strong evoked responses, and decompose temporally overlapping components. The general approach is shown to be consistent with the underlying physics of EEG, which specifies a linear mixing model of the underlying neural and non-neural current sources.},
