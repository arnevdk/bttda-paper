This article presents Block-Term Tensor Discriminant Analysis (BTTDA), a novel tensor-based feature extraction method for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Unlike traditional tensor decomposition techniques, BTTDA utilizes a flexible block-term structure that adapts to complex neural data for improved classification accuracy, particularly in ERP and motor imagery tasks. By iteratively fitting discriminant tensor blocks, BTTDA balances dimensionality reduction with discriminative power, outperforming existing methods on EEG datasets. This approach enhances neuroimaging analysis, offering a scalable solution with applications in neuroprosthetics and assistive technologies, thus advancing the capabilities of BCI systems.
