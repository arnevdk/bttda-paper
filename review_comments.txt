# Reviewer 1

This work proposed an incremental method toward the use of the tensor
decomposition methods on feature extraction of EEG signals. The innovation of
this new method is clear, i.e., reducing the error in the HODA method. The
manuscript is well writing and structured. The results well represent the
performance of the proposed method. Although the classification accuracy is not
of state-of-the-art performance, the manuscript points out an important factor
that influences the performance of tensor decomposition on the feature extraction
of EEG signal. I recommend acceptance after minor modifications.

(1) In the method part, two figures are used to explain the process of tensor
composition. However, these figures are the part of the proposed method. A
structured figure is necessary to show the process of proposed method from end
to end. The structured figure includes EEG signals, preprocessing, tensor
composition, feature extraction and classifier.

# Reviewer 2

The Results and discussion part is perfectly written but there are specific points which must be rectified

1. Block-Term Tensor Discriminant Analysis for the Brain-Computer Interfacing?
The title does not justify the type of paper seems like review article? Elaborate with proper
justification
2. Check the text there are some miss spellings
3. Concise Introduction and conclusion
4. At the end of each paragraph of reviewing you should write what you
concluded and concise the Review by clearly focusing on your objectives
5. Remove old references and add new references of 2023 and 2024

# Editor

We received comments from two exceedingly well qualified reviewers, as well as
a member of our Editorial Board. While they recognize the importance of the area
of work, the modest performance gains on relative small open source data sets
and lack of real time implementation are substantial limitations. These factors
will limit the impact of the present contribution and prevent us from
considering this work further for publication in the Journal of Neural
Engineering.

Thank you for submitting your work to JNE, and we encourage you to consider JNE
for your other manuscripts in the future.
